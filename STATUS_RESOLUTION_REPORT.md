# RevivaTech Project Status Resolution Report
**Date**: July 16, 2025  
**Analysis Type**: Ground Truth Assessment  
**Scope**: Complete project implementation status

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

After comprehensive analysis of the actual codebase, a **major discrepancy** has been identified between documentation claims and project structure:

### **Key Discovery**
- **Documentation Project**: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/` - Extensive planning and aspirational PRDs
- **Actual Implementation**: `/opt/webapps/website/` - Production-ready application with comprehensive features

### **Status Resolution**
- **RevivaTech is SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** in `/opt/webapps/website/`
- **Documentation in `/opt/webapps/revivatech/`** represents future planning, not current status
- **Conflict resolved**: Implementation claims vs pending todos reflect different project phases

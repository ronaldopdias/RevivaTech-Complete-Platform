# Container Networking & Proxy System Overhaul - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RevivaTech project currently suffers from fragmented container networking and proxy configuration that creates maintenance overhead, security vulnerabilities, and deployment fragility. This specification addresses the systematic overhaul of the container networking architecture to implement Docker best practices, eliminate hardcoded localhost references, and create a future-proof proxy system.

**Context:** The current system contains 166+ files with "revivatech_new_*" references, 50+ hardcoded localhost:3011 URLs, and mixed proxy approaches that lead to mixed content errors and container networking issues. This creates a brittle architecture that breaks when container names change and violates Docker networking best practices.

**Objective:** Transform the current ad-hoc networking approach into a robust, maintainable, and scalable container networking architecture that follows 2024 Docker best practices while ensuring zero-downtime operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Professional Container Naming Standardization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want consistent, professional container naming without temporary suffixes so that the infrastructure appears production-ready and maintenance operations are simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN all container names SHALL follow the pattern `revivatech_[service]` without "new" or temporary suffixes
2. WHEN containers are referenced in configuration files THEN they SHALL use the standardized names consistently across all environments
3. WHEN documentation refers to containers THEN it SHALL use the professional naming convention throughout
4. IF legacy container names exist THEN the migration process SHALL preserve data integrity and service availability
5. WHEN container names change THEN dependent services SHALL automatically adapt without manual intervention

### Requirement 2: Environment-Aware URL Configuration Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want centralized, environment-aware URL configuration so that services can communicate properly across different deployment scenarios without hardcoded localhost references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate internally THEN they SHALL use container networking (`BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL`) instead of localhost routing
2. WHEN client-side code needs backend access THEN it SHALL use environment-specific public URLs (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) or proxy routing
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL clearly distinguish between internal container communication and external access
4. IF container names change THEN URL configuration SHALL adapt automatically through environment variables
5. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN URL configuration SHALL be environment-specific without code changes

### Requirement 3: Robust Proxy System Implementation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a reliable proxy system that handles all API routing transparently so that mixed content errors are eliminated and service discovery is abstracted from application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend makes API calls THEN the proxy system SHALL route requests to appropriate backend services regardless of protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
2. WHEN container names or network topology changes THEN the proxy configuration SHALL continue functioning without application code modifications
3. WHEN debug endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL route through the same proxy system as other API calls for consistency
4. IF backend services are unavailable THEN the proxy SHALL provide appropriate error responses and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL use the same proxy routing as REST API calls

### Requirement 4: Service Discovery and Network Isolation

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper Docker network isolation and service discovery so that services communicate securely within container networks while maintaining external accessibility for development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate internally THEN they SHALL use Docker service names for automatic DNS resolution within the container network
2. WHEN external access is required THEN it SHALL be explicitly configured through port mapping and environment variables
3. WHEN network isolation is implemented THEN services SHALL only communicate through defined network interfaces
4. IF network topology changes THEN service discovery SHALL continue functioning through Docker's built-in DNS
5. WHEN security policies are applied THEN they SHALL prevent unauthorized inter-service communication

### Requirement 5: Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a safe migration process that ensures zero downtime and data integrity so that production services remain available during the networking overhaul.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration begins THEN current services SHALL remain operational until new configuration is validated
2. WHEN container names are changed THEN database connections and persistent data SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN proxy configuration is updated THEN existing API endpoints SHALL continue functioning without interruption
4. IF migration issues occur THEN automatic rollback mechanisms SHALL restore previous working state within 5 minutes
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN all monitoring and health checks SHALL validate system functionality

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] API response time < 500ms for 95th percentile (no degradation from current performance)
- [ ] Container startup time < 30 seconds for all services
- [ ] Network latency between containers < 10ms within same host
- [ ] Memory overhead from proxy system < 50MB additional usage

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing PostgreSQL and Redis data
- Cannot disrupt existing authentication and session management
- Must integrate with current Cloudflare tunnel configuration
- Required to use Docker Compose networking without Kubernetes migration
- Must support both development (localhost) and production (domain) access methods

### Business Constraints
- Must be delivered within 2-week development cycle
- Cannot cause more than 1 hour total downtime during implementation
- Must not require additional infrastructure costs
- Limited to existing development team resources

### Assumptions
- Current Docker containers will remain on single-host deployment
- Existing database schemas and data will remain unchanged
- Frontend build system (Next.js) configuration can be modified
- Existing SSL certificates and domain configuration will be preserved
- Development team has Docker networking expertise

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration must be updated first
- [ ] Environment variable schema must be finalized
- [ ] Service discovery patterns must be validated
- [ ] Proxy configuration testing must be completed

### External Dependencies
- [ ] No external service dependencies for core networking changes
- [ ] Cloudflare tunnel configuration may require updates for domain routing
- [ ] SSL certificate paths may need adjustment for container networking
- [ ] External monitoring systems may need endpoint updates

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Container Renaming Data Loss**: Database connection strings and persistent volumes may be lost during container renaming - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup and validation procedures before any container changes
- **Proxy Routing Failures**: New proxy configuration may break existing API endpoints - **Mitigation**: Parallel testing environment and gradual rollout with instant rollback capability
- **Network Connectivity Issues**: Service discovery may fail in container networking - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing of container DNS resolution and fallback mechanisms

### Medium Risk Items
- **Environment Variable Conflicts**: New environment variables may conflict with existing configuration - **Mitigation**: Environment variable validation and conflicts detection before deployment
- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: WebSocket proxy routing may be more complex than REST API routing - **Mitigation**: Dedicated testing of WebSocket connections through proxy system
- **Performance Degradation**: Additional proxy layer may introduce latency - **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking before and after implementation

### Low Risk Items
- **Documentation Updates**: Large number of files need documentation updates - **Mitigation**: Automated scripts to update common documentation patterns

# Better Auth Migration Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NextAuth to Better Auth migration was partially completed but left the system in a broken state with multiple authentication services running in parallel. The website is currently down due to authentication conflicts, and there are still NextAuth artifacts throughout the codebase that need to be properly migrated to Better Auth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audit Existing Better Auth Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and catalog all existing Better Auth files and components, so that I can reuse them instead of creating duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing the codebase THEN all existing Better Auth files SHALL be identified and documented
2. WHEN examining authentication components THEN their current functionality SHALL be assessed
3. WHEN reviewing Better Auth implementation THEN gaps and issues SHALL be identified
4. IF existing Better Auth code is functional THEN it SHALL be reused and integrated properly

### Requirement 2: Complete Authentication Service Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, unified authentication system using Better Auth, so that there are no conflicts between multiple auth services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN only Better Auth services SHALL be active
2. WHEN a user attempts to login THEN the system SHALL use Better Auth endpoints exclusively
3. WHEN authentication state is checked THEN the system SHALL use Better Auth session management
4. IF legacy authentication services exist THEN they SHALL be removed or properly integrated with Better Auth

### Requirement 3: Fix Authentication Service Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to login and maintain my session, so that I can access protected areas of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Better Auth backend
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL store session tokens properly
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN their session SHALL persist
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN all session data SHALL be cleared properly

### Requirement 4: Remove NextAuth Artifacts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all NextAuth references removed from the codebase, so that there are no conflicts or confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN no NextAuth imports SHALL be found
2. WHEN checking environment files THEN no NEXTAUTH_* variables SHALL exist
3. WHEN reviewing API routes THEN no NextAuth-specific routes SHALL exist
4. WHEN examining database schemas THEN no NextAuth-specific tables SHALL be referenced

### Requirement 5: Restore Website Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to be accessible and functional, so that I can use the RevivaTech services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the website THEN it SHALL load without errors
2. WHEN the frontend container starts THEN it SHALL remain stable and accessible
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL work seamlessly
4. WHEN users interact with the site THEN all features SHALL function properly

### Requirement 6: Implement Proper Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when authentication fails, so that I understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
3. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging purposes

### Requirement 7: Ensure Session Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to persist across browser refreshes, so that I don't have to login repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN their session SHALL remain active
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN their session SHALL persist if not expired
3. WHEN session tokens expire THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic refresh
4. WHEN refresh fails THEN the user SHALL be redirected to login

### Requirement 8: Test Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of the authentication flow, so that I can verify everything works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running authentication tests THEN all test cases SHALL pass
2. WHEN testing login flow THEN it SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN testing logout flow THEN it SHALL clear all session data
4. WHEN testing session validation THEN it SHALL return correct user data

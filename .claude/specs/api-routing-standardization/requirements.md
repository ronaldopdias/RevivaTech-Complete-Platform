# API Routing Standardization Requirements

## Executive Summary

RevivaTech's current API routing system requires critical standardization to resolve production deployment issues, eliminate hardcoded configurations, and align with industry best practices. This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for standardizing API routing across development, staging, and production environments.

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js with App Router, TypeScript strict mode
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with Better Auth integration  
- **Deployment**: Docker containerized with dual-domain setup (revivatech.co.uk, revivatech.com.br)
- **Development**: Hot reload with HTTPS/HTTP mixed configuration

### Existing Strengths (85% Best Practice Compliance)
1. **Environment-Aware URL Resolution** (`api-config.ts`)
   - Dynamic server/client-side detection
   - Container-aware internal/external routing
   - Sophisticated environment detection

2. **Better Auth Integration**
   - Modern authentication with proper baseURL detection
   - Environment-aware configuration
   - Security-first cookie handling

3. **Container Networking**
   - Clean separation of internal container communication
   - External access routing through proxy
   - Docker Compose network isolation

4. **TypeScript Implementation**
   - Strict type checking
   - Comprehensive interface definitions
   - Type-safe API client implementation

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### üö® High Priority Issues

#### 1. CLAUDE.md Rule Violation
- **File**: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/next.config.ts:41`
- **Issue**: Hardcoded Tailscale IP `'100.122.130.67:3010'`
- **Violation**: CLAUDE.md RULE 3 - "Never touch Tailscale IPs (100.x.x.x) - Never hardcode in config/code"
- **Impact**: 
  - Deployment fragility across environments
  - Project boundary violations
  - Configuration drift between developers
- **Business Risk**: HIGH - Deployment failures, inconsistent environments

#### 2. Mixed HTTP/HTTPS Configuration
- **Files**: Multiple configuration files across frontend/backend
- **Issue**: Inconsistent protocol handling between environments
- **Problems**:
  - Development uses HTTP, production uses HTTPS
  - Authentication failures due to protocol mismatches
  - Cookie security issues (SameSite, Secure flags)
  - CORS origin mismatches
- **Impact**: Authentication session persistence failures
- **Business Risk**: HIGH - User login/session issues in production

#### 3. Better Auth URL Misalignment  
- **File**: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/lib/auth/better-auth-client.ts`
- **Issue**: Recent changes force localhost for development
- **Problems**:
  - Line 16: `return 'http://localhost:3010'` hardcoded for development
  - May cause authentication failures when using Tailscale IPs
  - Inconsistent with environment-aware patterns elsewhere
- **Impact**: Authentication not working across different development setups
- **Business Risk**: HIGH - Developer productivity, authentication testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Inconsistent Environment Variable Names
- **Files**: `.env`, `backend/.env`, configuration files
- **Issue**: Multiple naming patterns for similar configurations
- **Examples**:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` vs `BETTER_AUTH_URL` vs `FRONTEND_URL_EN`
  - `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` vs internal hardcoded references
  - Inconsistent `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixing
- **Impact**: Configuration confusion, deployment errors
- **Business Risk**: MEDIUM - Deployment complexity, maintenance overhead

#### 5. Missing Fallback Mechanisms
- **File**: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/lib/utils/api.ts`
- **Issue**: API calls lack robust error handling for URL resolution failures
- **Problems**:
  - No retry mechanisms for failed API calls
  - No fallback URL resolution if primary fails
  - Inadequate error logging for troubleshooting
- **Impact**: Service interruptions, poor user experience
- **Business Risk**: MEDIUM - Service reliability, customer satisfaction

#### 6. Security Configuration Gaps
- **Files**: CORS configurations, SSL settings
- **Issues**:
  - Development mode allows insecure connections
  - Certificate validation disabled in some contexts
  - Incomplete CORS origin whitelisting for dual-domain setup
- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, authentication issues
- **Business Risk**: MEDIUM - Security posture, compliance issues

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Environment Variable Standardization
- **Standard Naming Convention**:
  ```
  # API URLs
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<external_api_url>
  BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL=<internal_container_url>
  
  # Authentication
  BETTER_AUTH_URL=<auth_base_url>
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=<frontend_url>
  
  # Development

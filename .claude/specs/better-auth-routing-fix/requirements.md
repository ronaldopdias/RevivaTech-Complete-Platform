# Better Auth Routing Fix - Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This PRD addresses critical routing issues in the RevivaTech authentication system following the NextAuth to Better Auth v1.3.4 migration. The primary issue is "Route not found" errors for Better Auth endpoints, preventing user authentication and blocking the completion of the authentication system overhaul.

## Business Context

### Current State
- NextAuth to Better Auth migration 95% complete
- Critical authentication endpoints returning 404 errors
- User authentication completely broken
- Development blocked on authentication-dependent features

### Business Impact
- **Critical**: Users cannot sign in or sign up
- **High**: Development velocity blocked on auth-dependent features
- **Medium**: Technical debt accumulation from configuration conflicts
- **Low**: Container resource inefficiency

## Problem Statement

### Primary Issues
1. **Route Handler Implementation**: Wrong Next.js App Router export pattern causing 404s
2. **Configuration Conflicts**: Duplicate better-auth configurations causing conflicts
3. **Database Schema Mismatches**: Column naming inconsistencies breaking auth flows
4. **Container Networking**: SSL and proxy configuration issues
5. **Missing Error Handling**: Poor debugging experience for auth failures

### Root Cause Analysis
- Better Auth route handlers using incorrect `export { handler as GET, handler as POST }` pattern
- Multiple configuration files creating initialization conflicts
- Database schema not aligned with Better Auth v1.3.4 expectations
- Container networking misconfigured for Better Auth endpoints

## User Requirements

### User Stories

**As a user**, I want to:
- Sign in with email and password without errors
- Sign up for a new account seamlessly
- Have my session persist across browser sessions
- Receive clear error messages for auth failures

**As a developer**, I want to:
- Debug authentication issues easily
- Have a single source of truth for auth configuration
- Use Better Auth APIs consistently
- Have proper error logging for auth failures

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Authentication (Priority: Critical)
- **REQ-001**: Email/password sign-in must work via `/api/auth/sign-in/email`
- **REQ-002**: Email/password sign-up must work via `/api/auth/sign-up/email`
- **REQ-003**: Session management must work via `/api/auth/session`
- **REQ-004**: Sign-out functionality must work via `/api/auth/sign-out`

#### Configuration Management (Priority: High)
- **REQ-005**: Single Better Auth configuration file
- **REQ-006**: Environment-specific configuration support
- **REQ-007**: Database connection properly configured
- **REQ-008**: Redis session store properly configured

#### Error Handling (Priority: High)
- **REQ-009**: Proper HTTP status codes for auth operations
- **REQ-010**: Detailed error logging for debugging
- **REQ-011**: User-friendly error messages
- **REQ-012**: Graceful fallback for network issues

#### Security (Priority: High)
- **REQ-013**: Secure session cookie configuration
- **REQ-014**: CSRF protection enabled
- **REQ-015**: Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- **REQ-016**: Secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **REQ-017**: Auth endpoints respond within 200ms
- **REQ-018**: Session validation within 50ms
- **REQ-019**: Database queries optimized for auth operations

#### Reliability
- **REQ-020**: 99.9% uptime for auth endpoints
- **REQ-021**: Graceful degradation during failures
- **REQ-022**: Automatic recovery from transient errors

#### Maintainability
- **REQ-023**: Clean, documented configuration
- **REQ-024**: Comprehensive error logging
- **REQ-025**: Easy debugging and troubleshooting

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Must Have)
- [ ] All Better Auth endpoints return 200 status codes
- [ ] Users can sign in with valid credentials
- [ ] Users can sign up with new accounts
- [ ] Sessions persist across browser restarts
- [ ] Sign-out properly clears sessions

#### Phase 2: Configuration Cleanup (Should Have)
- [ ] Single configuration file for Better Auth
- [ ] No NextAuth dependencies remaining
- [ ] Database schema aligned with Better Auth
- [ ] Container networking properly configured

#### Phase 3: Monitoring & Error Handling (Could Have)
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Performance monitoring for auth endpoints
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Technical KPIs
- **Authentication Success Rate**: >99%
- **Average Response Time**: <200ms
- **Error Rate**: <1%
- **Database Connection Pool Utilization**: <80%

#### Business KPIs
- **User Registration Completion**: >95%
- **User Login Success**: >98%
- **Session Duration**: Average 30+ minutes
- **Support Tickets for Auth Issues**: <5 per month

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Better Auth v1.3.4 (no downgrade)
- Must maintain existing user data
- Must work with current container setup
- Must use existing database schema (with modifications)

### Business Constraints
- Zero downtime deployment required
- Must complete within 2 weeks
- No budget for external services
- Must maintain security standards

### Assumptions
- Database migrations can be performed safely
- Container restarts are acceptable
- Better Auth v1.3.4 is stable for production
- Existing user passwords can be migrated

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- RevivaTech database availability
- Redis cache availability
- Container orchestration system
- Frontend authentication components

### External Dependencies
- Better Auth library v1.3.4
- Node.js runtime environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis session store

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: Database migration could corrupt user data
  - *Mitigation*: Full backup before migration
- **Breaking Changes**: Better Auth updates may break functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Pin to specific version, thorough testing

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Degradation**: New auth system may be slower
  - *Mitigation*: Performance testing and optimization
- **Configuration Errors**: Complex setup may introduce bugs
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and rollback plan

### Low Risk
- **User Experience**: Minor UI changes may confuse users
  - *Mitigation*: Clear messaging and gradual rollout

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

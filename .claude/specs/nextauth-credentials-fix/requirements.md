# NextAuth.js Credentials Authentication Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NextAuth.js authentication system is experiencing a "CredentialsSignin" error when users attempt to log in with valid credentials. While the NextAuth.js configuration is loading properly (no more "Configuration" errors), the credentials provider is failing to authenticate users against the backend API. This spec addresses the need to fix the NextAuth.js credentials authentication flow to ensure proper user authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: NextAuth.js Credentials Provider Diagnosis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand why the NextAuth.js credentials provider is failing so that I can identify the root cause of the CredentialsSignin error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs NextAuth.js diagnostics THEN it SHALL verify the credentials provider configuration
2. WHEN the system tests the authorize function THEN it SHALL confirm it properly calls the backend API
3. WHEN the system checks API integration THEN it SHALL verify the backend authentication endpoint is accessible from NextAuth.js
4. WHEN the system validates the auth flow THEN it SHALL identify any issues with request/response format between NextAuth.js and backend
5. IF credentials authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 2: NextAuth.js Backend Integration Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want NextAuth.js to successfully authenticate me against the backend API so that I can access protected areas of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NextAuth.js receives valid credentials THEN it SHALL successfully call the backend authentication API
2. WHEN the backend returns a successful authentication response THEN NextAuth.js SHALL create a proper user session
3. WHEN the backend returns user data THEN NextAuth.js SHALL properly map it to the NextAuth user object
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN NextAuth.js SHALL store the session and redirect appropriately
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN NextAuth.js SHALL return appropriate error information

### Requirement 3: NextAuth.js Error Handling Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when NextAuth.js authentication fails so that I can understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NextAuth.js credentials authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
2. WHEN the backend API is unreachable THEN NextAuth.js SHALL handle network errors gracefully
3. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN NextAuth.js SHALL return "CredentialsSignin" with proper error details
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN NextAuth.js SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN authentication errors happen THEN the frontend SHALL receive actionable error information

### Requirement 4: NextAuth.js Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want NextAuth.js to properly manage my authentication session so that I can navigate the application without unexpected logouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN NextAuth.js SHALL create a valid session with user information
2. WHEN a session exists THEN NextAuth.js SHALL provide session data to the application
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN NextAuth.js SHALL handle session refresh appropriately
4. WHEN users log out THEN NextAuth.js SHALL properly clear session data
5. WHEN session validation is needed THEN NextAuth.js SHALL verify session integrity

### Requirement 5: NextAuth.js Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure NextAuth.js is properly configured so that authentication works reliably across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NextAuth.js initializes THEN it SHALL have all required environment variables
2. WHEN the credentials provider is configured THEN it SHALL have proper authorize function implementation
3. WHEN callbacks are defined THEN they SHALL properly handle JWT and session data
4. WHEN pages are configured THEN they SHALL redirect to the correct login/error pages
5. WHEN NextAuth.js runs THEN it SHALL operate without configuration warnings or errors

# Customer Notification System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

RevivaTech currently lacks a comprehensive notification system to keep customers informed throughout the repair process. Customers have requested real-time updates about their device repair status, estimated completion times, and pickup availability. This specification addresses the need to implement a multi-channel notification system that enhances customer experience and reduces support inquiries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Repair Status Notifications

**User Story:** As a RevivaTech customer, I want to receive automatic notifications when my repair status changes so that I stay informed without needing to call or check the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repair status changes THEN the customer SHALL receive a notification within 5 minutes
2. WHEN a repair is completed THEN the customer SHALL receive pickup instructions and store hours
3. WHEN an estimated completion date changes THEN the customer SHALL be notified of the new timeline
4. IF a customer hasn't responded to pickup notification THEN a follow-up SHALL be sent after 48 hours
5. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative channels

### Requirement 2: Multi-Channel Communication Preferences

**User Story:** As a RevivaTech customer, I want to choose how I receive notifications (SMS, email, or push notifications) so that I can stay informed through my preferred communication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer creates an account THEN they SHALL be able to set notification preferences
2. WHEN notification preferences are updated THEN changes SHALL take effect for future notifications
3. WHEN a customer opts out of a channel THEN alternative channels SHALL still deliver critical updates
4. IF no preference is set THEN email SHALL be the default notification method

### Requirement 3: [Performance/Security Requirement]

**User Story:** As a [role/persona], I want [performance/security goal] so that [benefit/compliance].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [performance scenario] THEN [system response] SHALL [meet performance target]
2. WHEN [security scenario] THEN [system protection] SHALL [prevent/secure action]
3. WHEN [load/stress condition] THEN [system behavior] SHALL [maintain stability]
4. WHEN [security threat] THEN [system response] SHALL [log/block/alert]

### Requirement 4: [Integration/Compatibility Requirement]

**User Story:** As a [role/persona], I want [integration capability] so that [workflow benefit].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [integration scenario] THEN [system behavior] SHALL [maintain compatibility]
2. WHEN [data exchange occurs] THEN [format/validation] SHALL [ensure integrity]
3. WHEN [external system unavailable] THEN [fallback behavior] SHALL [maintain functionality]
4. WHEN [version changes] THEN [backward compatibility] SHALL [be preserved]

### Requirement 5: [Error Handling/Monitoring Requirement]

**User Story:** As a [role/persona], I want [error handling/monitoring] so that [operational benefit].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [error condition occurs] THEN [system response] SHALL [provide clear feedback]
2. WHEN [critical failure happens] THEN [logging/alerting] SHALL [capture details]
3. WHEN [recovery is possible] THEN [automatic recovery] SHALL [restore functionality]
4. WHEN [manual intervention needed] THEN [guidance/documentation] SHALL [assist resolution]

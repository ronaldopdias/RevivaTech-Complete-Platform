# Project Isolation PRD - Preventing Cross-Project Confusion

## Problem Statement

During development, confusion arose between two completely separate projects:
- **RevivaTech** (`/opt/webapps/revivatech/`) - The main website for RevivaTech.co.uk
- **Different Website** (`/opt/webapps/website/`) - A completely unrelated website project

This led to incorrect analysis, documentation contamination, and development delays.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Identified

1. **Documentation Contamination**
   - RevivaTech documentation files incorrectly referenced `/opt/webapps/website/` paths
   - Cross-project references in README.md and DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md
   - Confusion about which project was being discussed

2. **Architectural Misunderstanding**
   - RevivaTech was mistakenly analyzed as part of the `/opt/webapps/website/` infrastructure
   - Wrong ports, containers, and services were referenced
   - Component libraries were incorrectly attributed

3. **Configuration Issues**
   - Missing components in RevivaTech's configuration-driven system
   - Components referenced in config but not implemented
   - Basic display due to failed component rendering

## Solutions Implemented

### Phase 1: Missing Component Creation ‚úÖ

Created the missing components that were causing the basic display:

1. **FeatureHighlights Component**
   - Location: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/components/sections/FeatureHighlights.tsx`
   - Purpose: "Why Choose Us" section with alternating layout
   - Configuration: Supports alternating, grid, and card variants

2. **TestimonialsCarousel Component** 
   - Location: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/components/sections/TestimonialsCarousel.tsx`
   - Purpose: Customer testimonials with carousel functionality
   - Configuration: Auto-play, navigation controls, and responsive design

3. **CallToAction Component**
   - Location: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/components/sections/CallToAction.tsx`
   - Purpose: Final call-to-action sections with gradient backgrounds
   - Configuration: Multiple variants, backgrounds, and action buttons

### Phase 2: Documentation Cleanup ‚úÖ

Fixed all documentation contamination:

1. **DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md**
   - Removed all `/opt/webapps/website/` references
   - Updated commands to use correct RevivaTech paths
   - Fixed service endpoints and health checks

2. **README.md**
   - Corrected quick start instructions
   - Updated directory structure references
   - Fixed development commands and examples

### Phase 3: Component Registry Update ‚úÖ

Updated the component registration system:

1. **Registry Setup** (`/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/lib/components/setup.ts`)
   - Added FeatureHighlights registration
   - Added TestimonialsCarousel registration  
   - Added CallToAction registration
   - Proper TypeScript configurations for all components

2. **Type Safety**
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in dynamic heading generation
   - Ensured proper component category types
   - Validated component prop definitions

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Clear Project Boundaries

#### Directory Structure
```
/opt/webapps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ revivatech/          # RevivaTech.co.uk (port 3010)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/        # Next.js application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/         # Node.js API (future)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/          # RevivaTech shared components (future PT version)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/           # RevivaTech documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ website/            # SEPARATE, UNRELATED PROJECT
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-en/    # Different website English
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-pt/    # Different website Portuguese 
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/        # Different website backend
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/         # Different website shared components
```

#### Port Allocation
- **RevivaTech**: Port 3010 (main website)
- **Different Website**: Ports 3000, 3002, 3011, etc.

### 2. Documentation Standards

#### File Headers
All documentation files in `/opt/webapps/revivatech/` must include:

```markdown
# [Document Title] - RevivaTech Project

**Project**: RevivaTech.co.uk  
**Location**: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/`  
**Port**: 3010  
**Architecture**: Configuration-driven Next.js

---
```

#### Reference Validation
- All paths in RevivaTech docs must start with `/opt/webapps/revivatech/`
- No references to `/opt/webapps/website/` allowed
- Service URLs must use correct ports (3010 for RevivaTech)

### 3. Component Architecture Isolation

#### RevivaTech Components
- **Location**: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/components/`
- **Registry**: `/opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/lib/components/`
- **Configuration**: Configuration-driven with Zod validation
- **Imports**: Only internal RevivaTech components

#### Import Rules
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - RevivaTech internal imports
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';
import { HeroSection } from '@/components/sections/HeroSection';

// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Cross-project imports
import { Component } from '@shared'; // This is from /opt/webapps/website/
import Button from '/opt/webapps/website/shared/components/Button';
```

### 4. Development Workflow

#### Before Starting Any Task
1. **Verify Project Context**
   ```bash
   pwd  # Ensure you're in /opt/webapps/revivatech/
   ```

2. **Read Project-Specific Documentation**
   - `/opt/webapps/revivatech/CLAUDE.md` - Main configuration
   - `/opt/webapps/revivatech/README.md` - Project overview
   - `/opt/webapps/revivatech/Docs/Implementation.md` - Current tasks

3. **Confirm Port and Service**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3010/health  # RevivaTech service
   ```

#### Task Validation Checklist
- [ ] Task relates to RevivaTech.co.uk website
- [ ] Working directory is `/opt/webapps/revivatech/`
- [ ] No references to `/opt/webapps/website/` in code or docs
- [ ] Components use RevivaTech's configuration system
- [ ] Service endpoints use port 3010

### 5. Automated Prevention

#### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for cross-project references in RevivaTech
if grep -r "/opt/webapps/website/" /opt/webapps/revivatech/ --exclude-dir=node_modules; then
    echo "‚ùå Found references to /opt/webapps/website/ in RevivaTech project"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for incorrect imports
if grep -r "from '@shared'" /opt/webapps/revivatech/frontend/src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules; then
    echo "‚ùå Found @shared imports in RevivaTech (use @/components instead)"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Project isolation validated"
```

#### Documentation Linting
Create a script to validate documentation references:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-docs.sh
echo "Validating RevivaTech documentation..."

# Check for correct project paths
find /opt/webapps/revivatech/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "/opt/webapps/website/" {} \; | while read file; do
    echo "‚ùå $file contains incorrect path references"
done

# Check for correct port references
find /opt/webapps/revivatech/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "localhost:30[01][^0]" {} \; | while read file; do
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  $file may contain incorrect port references"
done

echo "‚úÖ Documentation validation complete"
```

## Future Prevention

### Team Education
1. **Onboarding Checklist** - New developers must understand project boundaries
2. **Code Review Guidelines** - Reviewers check for cross-project references
3. **Documentation Standards** - All docs must include project context

### Tooling
1. **IDE Configuration** - Set up workspace files for each project
2. **Linting Rules** - Custom ESLint rules to prevent cross-project imports
3. **CI/CD Validation** - Automated checks in build pipeline

### Monitoring
1. **Regular Audits** - Monthly checks for cross-project contamination
2. **Dependency Tracking** - Monitor imports and references
3. **Architecture Reviews** - Quarterly review of project boundaries

## Conclusion

This isolation crisis highlighted the critical importance of:
1. **Clear project boundaries** in multi-project repositories
2. **Consistent documentation** that accurately reflects project structure  
3. **Component architecture** that doesn't leak between projects
4. **Validation processes** to catch cross-project contamination early

The implemented solutions ensure RevivaTech operates as a completely independent project with its own configuration-driven architecture, while preventing future confusion between unrelated projects.

**Project Status**: ‚úÖ **ISOLATED AND OPERATIONAL**

# Phase 1: Trust Psychology Foundation - PRD

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Implement evidence-based trust psychology elements that appear within the critical 50ms first impression window to build customer confidence and drive conversions.

**Expected Impact**: 32% conversion improvement (proven with "No fix, no fee" guarantee), 15-20% booking increase through scarcity psychology, immediate trust establishment.

**Timeline**: Week 1-2 of implementation  
**Priority**: Critical (Foundation for all subsequent phases)

## Research Foundation

### The 50ms Trust Window
- Website visitors form first impressions in just 50 milliseconds
- 94% of first impressions relate directly to web design
- Trust signals must be visible immediately above the fold
- Computer repair customers have high anxiety about data security and service quality

### Proven Psychology Triggers for Repair Services
1. **Authority & Expertise**: Manufacturer certifications, years of experience
2. **Social Proof**: Customer statistics, completed repairs, satisfaction rates  
3. **Risk Reversal**: "No fix, no fee" guarantees, warranties
4. **Scarcity & Urgency**: Limited availability, same-day service
5. **Transparency**: Clear processes, honest pricing

### UK Market Psychology
- Brexit anxiety makes "Genuine Parts Available" messaging crucial
- Environmental consciousness values repair over replacement
- Local trust more important than corporate branding
- Mobile-first trust signals essential (72% mobile traffic)

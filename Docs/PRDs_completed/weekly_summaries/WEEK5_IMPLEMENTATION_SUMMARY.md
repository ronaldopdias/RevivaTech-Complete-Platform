- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notifications/[id]` - Individual notification management
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Bulk operations
- `GET /api/notifications/stats` - Analytics and metrics

### 6. Real-Time WebSocket API for Live Updates ✓
- **Bi-Directional Communication**: Full-duplex real-time communication
- **Authentication**: Token-based WebSocket authentication
- **Heartbeat System**: Connection health monitoring with automatic reconnection
- **Event Subscriptions**: Subscribe to specific channels (bookings, notifications)
- **Broadcasting**: System-wide alerts and targeted user messaging

**Features:**
- Server: Production-ready WebSocket server with connection pooling
- Client: React hooks for easy WebSocket integration
- Authentication: Secure token-based authentication
- Subscriptions: Channel-based event subscriptions

### 7. API Validation, Error Handling, and Rate Limiting ✓
- **Zod Validation**: Comprehensive request/response validation
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory rate limiting with configurable windows
- **Error Standards**: Standardized error responses with proper HTTP codes
- **Security**: CORS, authentication, authorization middleware
- **Monitoring**: Request/response logging and performance tracking

## 🏗️ API Architecture

### Request/Response Flow
```
Client Request → Rate Limiting → CORS → Authentication → Validation → Business Logic → Database → Response
```

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Customer, Technician, Admin, Super Admin roles
- **Session Management**: Persistent sessions with expiration
- **Authorization Guards**: Endpoint-level permission checks

### Validation Pipeline
```typescript
// Request validation with Zod schemas
const schema = z.object({
  deviceModelId: z.string().uuid(),
  repairType: z.nativeEnum(RepairType),
  // ... more fields
});

// Middleware automatically validates and provides typed data
const validatedData = (request as any).validatedBody;
```

## 📊 Performance & Scalability

### Rate Limiting
- **Tiered Limits**: Different limits for different endpoints
- **User-Based**: Per-user rate limiting with role-based adjustments
- **Adaptive**: Higher limits for authenticated users

### Optimization Features
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient database queries with proper includes
- **Pagination**: Consistent pagination across all list endpoints
- **Caching Ready**: Repository pattern supports easy caching integration
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connection optimization

### Error Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error handling with fallbacks
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker Ready**: Foundation for circuit breaker patterns

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Middleware Stack
```typescript
export const GET = ApiMiddleware.withMiddleware(
  async (request: NextRequest) => {
    // Handler logic
  },
  {
    requireAuth: true,
    roles: ['ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN'],
    validateBody: createBookingSchema,
    rateLimit: { windowMs: 60000, maxRequests: 10 },
  }
);
```

### WebSocket Integration
```typescript
// Server-side real-time updates
await wsServer.sendBookingUpdate(bookingId, customerId, {
  status: 'IN_PROGRESS',
  message: 'Your repair has started',
});

// Client-side subscription
const { subscribeToBookingUpdates } = useWebSocket({
  url: 'ws://localhost:8080',
  token: authToken,
});
```

### Type Safety
- **End-to-End Types**: TypeScript types from database to frontend
- **Request/Response Types**: Strongly typed API contracts
- **Validation**: Runtime validation with compile-time type checking

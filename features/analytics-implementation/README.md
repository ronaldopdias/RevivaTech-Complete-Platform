# Analytics Implementation - Spec-Driven Development
**RevivaTech Visitor Intelligence System**

## 📋 Methodology Overview

This analytics implementation follows the **Spec-Driven Development** methodology with 5 distinct phases for each feature.

## 🚀 5-Phase Workflow

```
1. /spec:plan → Feature List → [Approval Gate] ✅ COMPLETE
2. /spec:requirements → requirements.md → [Approval Gate] ✅ COMPLETE  
3. /spec:design → design.md → [Approval Gate] ✅ COMPLETE
4. /spec:tasks → tasks.md → [Approval Gate] ✅ COMPLETE
5. /spec:execute → Working Code → [Testing & Deploy] ⏳ READY
```

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ **Feature 1: Third-Party Analytics Integration - READY FOR EXECUTION**

**Progress**: Requirements → Design → Tasks → **READY TO EXECUTE**

#### **Completed Specifications**:
- **Requirements**: 25+ EARS format requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Design**: Complete technical architecture with security considerations
- **Tasks**: 10 TDD tasks with Red-Green-Refactor cycles

#### **Key Deliverables**:
- Google Analytics 4 integration
- Facebook Pixel conversion tracking
- PostHog session recording
- GDPR/CCPA consent management
- Performance optimization (<100ms impact)

#### **Ready to Execute**: 
```bash
/spec:execute third-party-analytics-integration
```

### ⏳ **Remaining Features - PENDING SPECIFICATION**

1. **utm-campaign-tracking** - UTM parameter tracking with attribution
2. **visitor-journey-analytics** - Session recording and flow visualization  
3. **unified-analytics-dashboard** - Comprehensive dashboard

## 🔧 Implementation Approach

### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. 🔴 **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. 🟢 **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests
3. 🔄 **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### **Quality Gates**
- **Requirements Gate**: EARS format, testable, complete ✅
- **Design Gate**: Addresses requirements, clear approach ✅
- **Tasks Gate**: Granular, actionable, test scenarios ✅
- **Execution Gate**: All tests pass, performance verified

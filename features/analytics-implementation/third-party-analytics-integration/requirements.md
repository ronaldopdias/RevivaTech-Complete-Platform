# Third-Party Analytics Integration - Requirements
**Feature**: Third-Party Analytics Integration  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Draft

## üìã Feature Overview

Integration of Google Analytics 4, Facebook Pixel, and PostHog into the RevivaTech platform with privacy-compliant consent management and performance optimization.

## üéØ Functional Requirements (EARS Format)

### R1: Google Analytics 4 Integration

**R1.1**: WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize Google Analytics 4 with the configured measurement ID

**R1.2**: WHEN a user navigates to a new page THEN the system SHALL send a page_view event to Google Analytics within 500ms

**R1.3**: IF the user has not consented to analytics tracking THEN the system SHALL NOT load or initialize Google Analytics scripts

**R1.4**: WHEN a user completes a booking THEN the system SHALL send a conversion event with transaction value to Google Analytics

**R1.5**: WHERE Google Analytics fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without affecting application functionality

### R2: Facebook Pixel Integration

**R2.1**: WHEN the application loads in production environment THEN the system SHALL initialize Facebook Pixel with the configured pixel ID

**R2.2**: WHEN a user views a service page THEN the system SHALL send a ViewContent event to Facebook Pixel with service details

**R2.3**: WHEN a user initiates a booking THEN the system SHALL send an InitiateCheckout event to Facebook Pixel

**R2.4**: WHEN a user completes a booking THEN the system SHALL send a Purchase event with value and currency to Facebook Pixel

**R2.5**: IF the user has opted out of marketing cookies THEN the system SHALL NOT load Facebook Pixel

### R3: PostHog Analytics Integration

**R3.1**: WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize PostHog with API key and host configuration

**R3.2**: WHEN session recording is enabled AND user has consented THEN the system SHALL start recording user sessions with PII masking

**R3.3**: WHERE sensitive information is displayed THEN the system SHALL mask the data in session recordings using data-mask attributes

**R3.4**: WHEN a feature flag is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve the flag value from PostHog within 100ms

**R3.5**: IF PostHog initialization fails THEN the system SHALL use default feature flag values

### R4: Consent Management

**R4.1**: WHEN a new user visits the site THEN the system SHALL display a consent banner within 2 seconds

**R4.2**: WHILE the user has not made a consent choice THEN the system SHALL NOT initialize any third-party analytics services

**R4.3**: WHEN a user grants consent THEN the system SHALL store the consent decision with timestamp for 365 days

**R4.4**: WHEN a user denies consent THEN the system SHALL respect the decision and not load analytics scripts

**R4.5**: WHERE a user changes consent preferences THEN the system SHALL immediately update tracking behavior

**R4.6**: WHEN Do Not Track is enabled in the browser THEN the system SHALL respect it regardless of consent status

### R5: Performance Requirements

**R5.1**: WHEN loading third-party analytics scripts THEN the system SHALL use async loading to prevent render blocking

**R5.2**: WHERE multiple analytics events occur THEN the system SHALL batch events with maximum batch size of 10 events

**R5.3**: WHEN measuring page load performance THEN the total impact of analytics SHALL NOT exceed 100ms

**R5.4**: IF analytics event sending fails THEN the system SHALL queue events locally for retry

**R5.5**: WHEN the event queue exceeds 100 events THEN the system SHALL remove oldest events first

### R6: Data Privacy & Security

**R6.1**: WHEN transmitting analytics data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption

**R6.2**: WHERE personally identifiable information exists THEN the system SHALL NOT include it in analytics events

**R6.3**: WHEN anonymizing IP addresses THEN the system SHALL remove the last octet before transmission

**R6.4**: IF GDPR data deletion is requested THEN the system SHALL provide user data deletion capability

**R6.5**: WHEN storing consent decisions THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail with timestamps

### R7: Error Handling

**R7.1**: WHERE analytics service initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error without exposing it to users

**R7.2**: WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry failed requests with exponential backoff

**R7.3**: IF all analytics services fail THEN the application SHALL continue functioning normally

**R7.4**: WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics event logs in console

## üìè Non-Functional Requirements

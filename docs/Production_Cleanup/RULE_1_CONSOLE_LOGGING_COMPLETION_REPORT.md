## STEP 4: DECISION ✅

**🤖 AI Recommendation:** **GRADUATED CLEANUP STRATEGY** (Confidence: 95%)

**Strategic Decision:** Three-phase incremental cleanup approach

**Phase 1: CRITICAL SECURITY CLEANUP (2-3 hours)**
- **Priority**: Authentication, payment, sensitive data logging
- **Target**: 40 files, ~400 console statements
- **Risk**: HIGH - Must preserve error handling while removing exposure

**Phase 2: PRODUCTION LOGGING REPLACEMENT (6-8 hours)**
- **Priority**: API routes, services, middleware
- **Target**: 120 files, ~1,200 console statements  
- **Risk**: MEDIUM - Replace with proper logging services

**Phase 3: DEVELOPMENT CLEANUP (4-6 hours)**
- **Priority**: Component lifecycle, debugging, performance logs
- **Target**: 286 files, ~1,251 console statements
- **Risk**: LOW - Safe removal of development debugging

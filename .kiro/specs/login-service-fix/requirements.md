# Login Service User Experience Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Users are experiencing login failures when attempting to authenticate with what they believe are correct credentials. Investigation reveals that the authentication system is working correctly, but users are entering incorrect password case sensitivity. The system needs better user experience improvements to guide users to successful authentication and provide clearer feedback about credential requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Password Case Sensitivity User Guidance

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear guidance about password requirements, so that I can enter my credentials correctly on the first attempt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an incorrect password THEN the system SHALL provide helpful hints about password format requirements
2. WHEN password validation fails due to case sensitivity THEN the system SHALL suggest checking capitalization
3. WHEN users repeatedly fail authentication THEN the system SHALL provide progressive assistance without revealing the actual password

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Messages for Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want specific and helpful error messages when login fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails due to incorrect password THEN the system SHALL provide contextual error messages
2. WHEN a user account exists but password is wrong THEN the system SHALL distinguish this from "user not found" errors
3. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the temporary restriction and when to retry

### Requirement 3: Demo Account Credentials Visibility

**User Story:** As a developer or tester, I want easy access to demo account credentials, so that I can quickly test the authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL display demo account credentials prominently on the login form
2. WHEN demo credentials are shown THEN they SHALL include the correct case-sensitive passwords
3. WHEN demo accounts are used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this is for testing purposes

### Requirement 4: Password Strength and Format Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand password requirements before and during entry, so that I can create and enter passwords correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user focuses on the password field THEN the system SHALL show password format requirements
2. WHEN creating or changing passwords THEN the system SHALL validate format in real-time
3. WHEN password requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 5: Authentication State Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during the authentication process, so that I understand what's happening and when it's complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback before redirecting
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show error states with actionable next steps

### Requirement 6: Credential Recovery Assistance

**User Story:** As a user who has forgotten my password details, I want easy access to password recovery options, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL provide a clear password reset process
2. WHEN password reset is initiated THEN the system SHALL send clear instructions via email
3. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contact information for support

### Requirement 7: Login Form Usability Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and accessible login form, so that I can authenticate quickly and easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering credentials THEN the form SHALL provide appropriate input validation and formatting
2. WHEN using the form on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly
3. WHEN using assistive technologies THEN the form SHALL be fully accessible with proper ARIA labels

### Requirement 8: Authentication Analytics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want insights into authentication patterns and failures, so that I can identify and resolve user experience issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log relevant metrics without storing sensitive data
2. WHEN patterns of failure are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators to potential issues
3. WHEN users experience repeated failures THEN the system SHALL provide administrators with anonymized failure analysis

# Session Persistence Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Users are experiencing automatic logout when refreshing pages, navigating between pages, or returning to previous pages. This breaks the user experience and forces users to repeatedly log in during their session. This spec addresses the need to implement robust session persistence that maintains user authentication state across all navigation scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Session State Persistence

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my authentication state to persist when I refresh the page so that I don't have to log in again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes any page while logged in THEN the system SHALL maintain their authentication state
2. WHEN a user navigates to a different page THEN the system SHALL preserve their login session
3. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL keep them logged in
4. WHEN a user closes and reopens a browser tab THEN the system SHALL restore their session if still valid
5. WHEN session data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 2: Token Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want authentication tokens to be stored securely and persistently so that user sessions remain stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL store authentication tokens in persistent storage
2. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms (httpOnly cookies or encrypted localStorage)
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic refresh before logout
4. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL clear invalid tokens and redirect to login
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL completely clear all stored authentication data

### Requirement 3: Authentication State Hydration

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want the application to quickly recognize my authentication state when loading any page so that I have immediate access to authenticated features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page loads THEN the system SHALL check for existing valid authentication tokens
2. WHEN valid tokens are found THEN the system SHALL restore the user's authentication state
3. WHEN authentication state is restored THEN the system SHALL load user-specific data and permissions
4. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL clear invalid data and show login state
5. WHEN authentication check is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 4: Cross-Tab Session Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user with multiple tabs open, I want my authentication state to be synchronized across all tabs so that logging out in one tab affects all tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs out in one tab THEN all other tabs SHALL reflect the logged-out state
2. WHEN a user logs in in one tab THEN other tabs SHALL update to show the logged-in state
3. WHEN a session expires in one tab THEN all tabs SHALL handle the expiration consistently
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast the change to all tabs
5. WHEN tabs detect state changes THEN they SHALL update their UI accordingly

### Requirement 5: Session Recovery and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle authentication errors gracefully and provide clear feedback when session issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL maintain local session state until connectivity returns
2. WHEN the backend is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry authentication validation
3. WHEN session validation fails permanently THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for troubleshooting
5. WHEN session recovery is impossible THEN the system SHALL guide users to re-authenticate with minimal friction

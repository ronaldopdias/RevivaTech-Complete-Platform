# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RevivaTech website is currently down due to missing Material-UI dependencies in the AdminLayout component. The component is trying to import from `@mui/material` and `@mui/icons-material` packages that are not installed, and there are also export issues preventing the component from being properly imported. This spec addresses fixing these dependency issues and ensuring the admin interface works correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AdminLayout component to work without Material-UI dependencies, so that the website can load without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AdminLayout component is loaded THEN it SHALL NOT attempt to import from `@mui/material` or `@mui/icons-material`
2. WHEN the AdminLayout component is rendered THEN it SHALL use existing UI components from the project's component library
3. WHEN the component is imported THEN it SHALL be properly exported and available for use

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use consistent design patterns across the application, so that the admin interface matches the existing RevivaTech brand theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing Material-UI components THEN the AdminLayout SHALL use components from the existing UI library
2. WHEN styling the admin interface THEN it SHALL follow the RevivaTech brand color palette (Trust Blue, Professional Teal, Neutral Grey)
3. WHEN implementing navigation THEN it SHALL use Lucide React icons instead of Material-UI icons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to access the admin interface without errors, so that I can manage the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to admin pages THEN the AdminLayout SHALL render without module resolution errors
2. WHEN the admin interface loads THEN it SHALL display proper navigation with working icons
3. WHEN using the admin interface THEN it SHALL maintain responsive design principles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the website to be stable and error-free, so that users can access all functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to missing dependencies
2. WHEN hot reload occurs THEN the application SHALL rebuild successfully without module errors
3. WHEN accessing any page THEN the application SHALL not crash due to import issues

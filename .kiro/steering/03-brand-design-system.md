## Trust-Building Design Principles
1. **Immediate Trust Signals**: Always include trust elements above the fold
2. **Transparent Pricing**: Show clear, honest pricing without hidden fees
3. **Human Connection**: Use authentic customer photos and technician profiles
4. **Process Transparency**: Clearly explain repair process and timelines
5. **Risk Reversal**: Prominent guarantees, warranties, and "no fix, no fee" badges

## Required Components for New Pages
- **TrustSignal**: Customer metrics, certifications, satisfaction rates
- **TestimonialCard**: Authentic customer reviews with photos
- **PricingDisplay**: Transparent pricing with trust elements
- **ProcessStep**: Clear repair process explanation
- **CertificationBadge**: Professional credentials and verifications

## Color Usage Guidelines
- **Primary CTAs**: Use Trust Blue (#ADD8E6) for "Book Repair", "Get Quote"
- **Secondary Actions**: Use Professional Teal (#008080) for "Learn More", process steps
- **Body Text**: Use Neutral Grey (#36454F) for readability and trust
- **Trust Elements**: Combine Trust Blue and Professional Teal for credibility signals
